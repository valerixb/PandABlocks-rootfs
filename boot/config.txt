# This file contains configuration settings.  In this file network and other
# settings can be adjusted.

# If ADDRESS and NETMASK are not both specified DHCP will be used instead.
# The ADDRESS field can be set to a four part dotted IP address followed by a
# network mask specification thus:
#
#   ADDRESS = 172.23.252.202
#   NETMASK = 255.255.240.0

# If the ADDRESS field has been set then the GATEWAY and DNS fields should be
# set:
#
#   GATEWAY = 172.23.240.254
#   DNS = 172.23.5.13 172.23.4.1 130.246.8.13

# Optionally the DNS search domain can be set:
#
#   DNS_SEARCH = diamond.ac.uk

# The NTP server or servers can be specified here:
#
#   NTP = 172.23.240.2 172.23.199.1
NTP = 194.47.252.176

# The machine hostname can be specified here:
#
#   HOSTNAME = panda

# To skip loading any zpackages at startup, either for testing or as an
# override to recover from a faulty zpkg install:
#
#   NO_ZPKG
